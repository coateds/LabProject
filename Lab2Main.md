# Lab Project Two
My first lab was installed on equipment available to me during a contract. It was so successful that I purchased a suitable computer to run HyperV with at least four concurrent guests and room to store many more.

The goals of this lab include
* More experience with HyperV
* Windows and Linux Guests
* Work with package managers OneGet and Chocolatey
* Lots of automation
* Chef
* Jenkins

The work and documentation will be organized into projects. Each will include an open-ended document here that will be a combination of blog, install and configuration instructions and reference materials.
